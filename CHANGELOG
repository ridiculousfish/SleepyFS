1.1 2003/06/16
Add tarfs file system to mount tar files (requires python 2.3's tarfile,
but rest of code should work without it).
- change mount code to allow filesystem to support multiple mount points,
  return multiple file handles
- add sync code to rpchelp/rpc, since mount server now needs to sync w/ nfs
  server


1.01 2003/06/09

Since pyfs fileids and filehandles aren't persistent across restarts,
fix to have a random starting point (recognize stale file handles,
return ESTALE

Fix rpcgen to raise instances, not class + args syntax (rpc still needs
fixing)

Add graceful shutdown code for UDP.  (For TCP, I'd need to restructure
the code to use select (): let me know if this is an issue.)

Discard packets which are too short, instead of throwing an exception
and breaking out of receive loop.

Fix to allow -t on command line to specify TCP.
